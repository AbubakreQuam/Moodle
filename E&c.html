        <h3>Definition and Explanation:</h3>
        <div class="section-content1">
          <p>Welcome to Module 1, where we delve into a critical vulnerability that poses a significant threat to blockchain networks – the 51% Attack. In simple terms, this occurs when an attacker gains control of more than 50% of the network's computing power. This level of control is a fundamental breach of the decentralized nature of blockchain, allowing the attacker to manipulate transactions and control the addition of new blocks to the blockchain. </p>
          <p>Now, let's break it down further. In a decentralized system, the power is distributed among many participants, making it difficult for any single entity to control the entire network. However, in a 51% attack, the attacker crosses a dangerous threshold, gaining majority control and upsetting the balance. </p>
          </div>
        
          <h3> Real-world Examples:</h3> 
        <div class="section-content1">
              <p>To understand the real-world implications, let's explore notable examples:</p3>
              <p>1.	Bitcoin Gold Attack (2018): In 2018, Bitcoin Gold became a victim of a 51% attack. The attacker, with majority control, was able to reverse transactions and engage in the malicious practice of double-spending. </p>
              <p>2.	Ethereum Classic Attacks (2019 and 2020): Ethereum Classic faced multiple 51% attacks in 2019 and 2020. These incidents raised significant concerns within the community about the overall security of the network. </p>
          </div>
        
        
        <h3>Impact and Potential Consequences:</h3>
          <div class="section-content1">
            <p><b>Now, let's grasp the potential fallout from a 51% attack: </b></p>
            <p>•	Double-Spending: The attacker can spend the same cryptocurrency more than once, directly undermining the integrity of transactions. </p>
            <p>•	Theft of Funds: With control over the majority of the network, the attacker can divert funds and disrupt the normal flow of transactions. </p>
            <p>•	Network Disruption: A successful attack can disrupt the normal functioning of the blockchain network, eroding trust among users and stakeholders. </p>
          </div>
          
          
          <h3>Mitigation Strategies:</h3>
          <div class="section-content1">
            <p>Understanding the potential risks is crucial, but equally important is knowing how to mitigate them. </p>
            <p>Here are some strategies: </p>
            <p>1.	Robust Consensus Protocols (e.g., Proof-of-Stake): Implement advanced consensus mechanisms to make it economically infeasible for attackers to amass the computing power required for a 51% attack. </p>
            <p>2.	Decentralization of Mining Power: Distribute mining power across a large number of participants to reduce the risk of a single entity gaining majority control. </p>
            <p>3.	Community Vigilance and Response: Establish a vigilant community capable of quickly identifying and responding to unusual activities. Community involvement is key in mitigating the impact of a potential attack. </p>
